sambaflash (SAM-BA Flash) is a little program
which is used by samba for flash programming.

samba (SAM-BA) is a SAM Boot Agent for Atmel AT91SAM microcontrollers.
It is interfaces with SAM-BA firmware in microcontrollers
and allow SRAM and Flash programming, view registers etc.

When the samba 'flash' command is given, this application is
loaded into RAM and is executed for every page. samba communicates with this
application to perform the actual FLASH programming. Once the process is
complete, control returns to SAM-BA.

need to compile this application as it is already a part of samba.

Specifically, the sambaflash.c file in samba contains an embedded version of
the binary image for this program (sambaflash.bin), obtained by typing
'make'. If you want to make changes, then recompile this program and update
sambaflash.c with the new file.
